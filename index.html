                    Shah Jahan, came to Delhi shifting his capital from Agra to Delhi, the fort was his idea of
                    residence.
                    It was then famous as the Qila-e-Mubarak. The octagonal fort, built in red sandstone, stands proudly
                    amid the din and commotion of Old Delhi. It draws visitors in great numbers every day.</p>
